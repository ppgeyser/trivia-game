# trivia-game

This trivia game is my third project working with javascript/jquery for the UCSD Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. This project showcases my understanding of javascript timers. 

In this trivia game, you have 30 seconds to answer ten questions about the show "The Office." The game will track how many questions you got correct, incorrect, and ran out of time for as well as display screens for each situation as well as the final score at the end of the gamne.
