# "The Office" Trivia Game!

In this trivia game, you have 30 seconds per round to answer ten questions about the show "The Office." The game will track how many questions you got correct, incorrect, and ran out of time for; display screens for each situation; and display the final score at the end of the game. 

This trivia game is my third project working with javascript/jquery. This project showcases my understanding of javascript timers, as well as building on what I have learned in my previous projects with regards to DOM manipulation, javascript events, etc.
